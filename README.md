#  Unity ECS Top-Down Shooter

Welcome to a modular and high-performance **top-down shooter** built with **Unityâ€™s ECS (Entity Component System)** and **DOTS (Data-Oriented Technology Stack)**. This project is a perfect example of scalable gameplay where systems, components, and entities work together to deliver dynamic game mechanics.
